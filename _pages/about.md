Hi all! I am currently a second-year PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Cambridge, co-supervised by [Professor Richard Turner](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Aditya Nori](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/adityan/){:target="\_blank"} (Microsoft Research). At Cambridge, I am a member of [Christ's College](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. I am interested in exploring how machine learning can be deployed ethically in healthcare practice. Currently, I focus on fairness in ML for healthcare as well as under-explored perspectives of fairness in ML, such as the characterization of fairness with respect to exploration (in online or bandit settings).

I am funded through the Microsoft Research PhD Scholarship Programme as part of the ESPRC Prosperity Partnership "Machine Learning for Tomorrow: Efficient, Flexible, Robust and Automated." 

I grew up in Bellevue, Washington, received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and worked for two years as a Research Software Engineer at Microsoft Research UK, in the Health Intelligence group.
